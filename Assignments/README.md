# Assignments and Opt-Out Challenges

Engineering students possess vastly different programming skills and experience.
This situation can make it difficult for instructors to create activities from which everyone can benefit.
To address this issue, this course features two types of assignments.
The basic exercises focus on the fundamentals of the programming language, with elementary questions and complementary programming challenges.
Every opt-out assignment typically consists of a programming challenge that showcases a mastery of pertinent programming concepts.
On every occasion, students must elect to complete the basic assignment or the opt-out challenge, but not both.
Seasoned programmers are strongly encouraged to choose the latter option, and may be forced to attempt the opt-out challenge is some instances.
Students registered in the graduate section are required to complete the opt-out challenges.
An opt-out challenge is graded as satisfactory (full credit) or unsatisfactory (no credit); a working prototype must be presented in class.
