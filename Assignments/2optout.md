# JSON

JSON is an open standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs.
It is the primary data format used for asynchronous browser/server communication (AJAJ), largely replacing XML (used by AJAX).
Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON is a language-independent data format.
Code for parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in many programming languages.
