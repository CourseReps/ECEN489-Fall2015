# JSON

JSON is an open standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs.
It is the primary data format used for asynchronous browser/server communication (AJAJ), largely replacing XML.
Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON is a language-independent data format.
Code for parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in many programming languages.

## Action Items

1. Write a program that can curl information from a website of your choice, extract attribute-value pairs with real-time data, and wrap this information into a JSON object.
2. Write a second program that can take a JSON object and outputs an HTML or Markdown file.

Using Git and GitHub, commit your code as a CMake project in a directory labeled `2optout`.
