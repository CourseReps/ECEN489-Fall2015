# Hamming Codes

[Hamming codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code) are a family of linear error-correcting codes, the most famous of which is the (7,4)-code.
This latter code can be employed to detect up to two-bit errors or correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors.

## Action Item
1. Implement a [(7,4) Hamming code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming(7,4)) encoder and a corresponding decoder.
2. Show that your encoder/decoder pair work on arbitrary binary sequences.
3. Show that your code can correct one error per codeword.

Using Git and GitHub, commit your code as a CMake project in a directory labeled `1optout`.
