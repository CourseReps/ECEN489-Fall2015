# Project 1: Data Acquisition and Actuation

Project 1 focuses on the integration of computation, networking and physical processes.
The goal is to create an iterative cycle where the state of a physical entity is acquired through various sensors;
this information can subsequently be employed for the purpose of decision and control;
and an action (or a set of actions) is then applied to the physical entities through actuation.
These actions alter the state of the physical entities, guiding the system towards a desired goal.
This feedback loop continues in real-time as the embedded system strives to optimally manage available resources.


## Managing Water Resources

The underlying topic for this semester is smart water management.
During this first project, we are primarily interested in getting microcontrollers to interact with four major components: an infrared (IR) distance sensor, a pump, a flow sensor, and a valve.
In addition, data will have to be transferred from the microcontroller to a Linux box using a serial connection and Bluetooth.
