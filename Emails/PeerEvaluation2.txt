Hello,

At the end of a project, every student is required to complete a Peer
Evaluation Form to assess the individual contributions the members of
their team. A rubric that explains the four evaluation criteria is
provided below.

• Effort & Quality: Work diligently, professional contributions,
well-documented code, pertinent and reusable elements.
• Creativity & Resourcefulness: Ingenious, imaginative, resourceful
and efficient.
• Participation & Human Interactions: Share responsibilities, prepare
for meetings, eloquent and precise in interactions, conscientious,
respectful, enthusiastic and positive.
• Deliverables & Timeliness: Present and punctual during work
sessions, respect deadlines, work on assigned targets.

You have a maximum of (number of members x 12) points to allocate to
the columns. These points can only be assigned as integers. The
maximum grade per member-criterion is five points. The total should be
the sum of the four grades per team member.
