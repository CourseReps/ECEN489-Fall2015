# Data Acquisition &amp; Embedded Systems


## Description

The goal of this multidisciplinary project-based laboratory course is to provide instruction on data acquisition, system-level integration and design through a range of hands-on activities that complement the traditional classroom experience.
This includes circuit prototyping, PCB fabrication, microcontrollers and C++ programming, networking, and data visualization.
The main focus is on modular application development, algorithms, information management, control and actuation.
In addition, emphasis is put on team work, presentation skills, time management, creativity and innovation.


## Objectives

1. Enhance engineering education by facilitating learning through engineering projects.
2. Review the basics of circuit building, programming concepts, computer-aided design tools, the fundamentals of microcontrollers.
3. Foster leadership and team work, with division of labor, complementary tasks, discussion and integration.
4. Develop the ability to bridge theoretical concepts and practical tasks.
5. Master elements of experiential learning such as abstract conceptualization, active experimentation, concrete experience, reflective observation.
6. Improve transferable engineering skills and the ability to integrate different concepts.
7. Develop confidence and leadership.
8. Promote creativity and critical thinking.
9. Refine presentation skills and the ability to conduct and manage projects.

# Teensy-3.1
Teensy 3.1 library for kicad

## Library

This just contains library file with external pinout (not represented smd pins on bottom side).

## Module footprint

Footprint of external pinout (not represented smd pins on bottom side).

## How to: Add library

Go to *Preferences/Set Active libraries* then use *add* button and look for your libraries. It can be wherever you want.

If you move the library to another path, you must relocated it to keep using it.

## How to: Add Module

**In lasts versions you must store the module footprint on a *.pretty* folder.** 

1. Move module to your project folder and create a modules.pretty folder.
2. Go to *preferences/Edit Library Table* and and select *Append with wizard*
2. Select Kicad(*.Pretty folder) containing .kicad_mod files)
3. Click on Next and select *Use enviroment variable in path* and select your project folder path.
4. Clic on Next and click on *Add FP Libraries*. In the new window that just openned look for your *.pretty folder, click ok and Finish and you're done!
