#cURL/JSON

This assignment consists of two programs. 1 reads data from a website using the curl command. This website has data on the exchange rate from various currencies to USD. This program then extracts the appropriate data and packs it into a JSON object in a JSON file. The other program reads in this JSON file, extracts the data, and outputs a markdown file with the data from the JSON file. Both programs run without arguments.
