	Class to handle encoding and decoding (with error handling) (7,4) Hamming codes.
	Variables are 8-bit unsigned because the largest piece of data handled is a 7-bit vector.
	In the interest of memory conservation for scaling to large operations, the smallest
	data type that will accomodate this is used.
