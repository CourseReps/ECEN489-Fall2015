# Opt-out #2: JSON Wrapping & Unwrapping

This program curls html data from the internet (Game of Thrones cast webpage, for example) and creates a JSON object of all characters' and corresponding actors' name. This JSON object is read and converted into a Markdown (.md) file.

Note: The application requires libcurl.dll to run. So **DO NOT delete** the build folder and the dll file within it.

1. Build and run the application
2. JSON data file and Markdown files are generated
